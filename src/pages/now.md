# What I'm Doing Now
--------------------

The alternative version of this page is written in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Bahasa.](/now/id){.a-langSwitcher}

I am living with my parents in Bogor. Well-adjusted so far. I am going to stay
for another 2-3 months before renting a dorm in Bogor or Depok. Jakarta is not an option.

I am working on the fundamentals. There are many potholes to be plugged.

I am no longer into crypto. I am putting my money into mutual funds and gold.

I am intending to start a family. I am already 31 and I found a wisdom in matrimony. I need to save up enough to finance this wonderful endeavour. It's a big responsibility.
