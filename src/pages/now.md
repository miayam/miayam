# What I'm Doing Now
--------------------

The alternative version of this page written in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Bahasa.](/now/id){.a-langSwitcher}

People seldom ask me what Iâ€™m doing now.

I am in Bandung, Indonesia.

I am relearning PHP syntax on Codecademy. Enough PHP to build WordPress themes and plugins. Dear PHP experts, please [recommend me](mailto:muhammaddeni90@gmail.com) some good resources on the subject. I am in a tutorial hell right now.

I am taking [Complete Intro to Computer Science](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/), [Making TypeScript Stick](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/typescript-practice/) and [Figma for Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/figma). Stockbit pays the subscription bills.

I am working on a side project using [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) as a GraphQL/REST API endpoint and SSG of my choice ([Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Astro ðŸŒŸ](https://astro.build/)) in the front. It is a boilerplate to decouple backend and frontend on [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) app.

I am prepared for the worst by saving and investing. [Here's how it's done](https://miayam.io/articles/aldi-taher-tujuan-investasi-dan-manajemen-keuangan).
