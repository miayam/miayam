# What I'm Doing Now
--------------------

The alternative version of this page is written in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Bahasa.](/now/id){.a-langSwitcher}

I am taking 1-month unpaid leaves. 

I am getting better. I hope I can function soon.

I am in Bogor.

I am trying to rebrand this blog site. I am deleting blog posts about love and useless stuff. 

I am learning stuff. It's a good stuff.
