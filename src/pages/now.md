# What I'm Doing Now
--------------------

The alternative version of this page is written in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Bahasa.](/now/id){.a-langSwitcher}

I don't think people give a damn about what Iâ€™m doing now.

I am in Special Region of Yogyakarta, beyond the reign of Sunda Empire.

I am adjusting myself to its weather and culture. So far, so good.

I am lowering my expenditure without compensating my current life style.

I am strenghtening the fundamentals, unlearning things I think I know.

I am a shitty web developer and moving towards becoming a more realible shitty web developer
by writing good tests. Yet another good investment I overlook.

I am an inward-looking man now.

I am avoiding social interaction for better or worse.

I am trying to say no to almost everything and say yes to almost nothing.

I am saying yes to DSA (Data Structure & Algorithm), Investment, and Web Development (PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I am willing to expand
upon those 3 if needs be. I hate React and here I am. 

I am saying no to Web3, AI, ML, mathematics, alcohol, sex, drugs, Python, Java, Rust, Go, and Ruby on Rails.

I am getting rid of freelance work for the next 6 months. Living off salary and swing trading.
