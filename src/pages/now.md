# What I'm Doing Now
--------------------

The alternative version of this page is written in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Bahasa.](/now/id){.a-langSwitcher}

I am watching all episodes of Terrace House on Netflix. They are probably scripted.

I am no longer concerned about what women want from me.

I am fantasizing living with a girl I like with two cats and a dog. 

I am taking the deep dive into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. I bet on early-2000s web technology.

I am reading No Longer Human illustrated by Junji Ito. Loving it!

I am fighting my past self.
