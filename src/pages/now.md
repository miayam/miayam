# What I'm Doing Now
--------------------

The alternative version of this page is written in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Bahasa.](/now/id){.a-langSwitcher}

I am working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, and PHP.

I am studying algorithm and data structure. Enough computer science to get by. Enough to get my foot in the door.

>**Me**: Knock! Knock!

>**Interviewer**: Who's there?

I am focusing my energy on early-2000s web technology. WordPress is a good investment.

I am living in Bogor with my parents. They are both healthy. I am not.

I am taking Real Life English course.

I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.
