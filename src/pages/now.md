# What I'm Doing Now
--------------------

The alternative version of this page is written in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Bahasa.](/now/id){.a-langSwitcher}

I am tired of working on the fundamentals but there are many potholes to be plugged.

I am binge-reading One Piece on [Manga Plus](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/). I am on The Sabaody Arc right now. It's a good read. I should have read it in senior high, but I didn't find it interesting.

I am looking for accomodation in Jabodetabek.

I am exercising for coding interviews. I am going to blog about it.

This page is inspired by [a good idea from Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).
