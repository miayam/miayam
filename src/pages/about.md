## The Blog
The alternative version of this page written in [🇮🇩 Bahasa.](/about/id)

The best thing I've ever done with my life. A place where I can be myself. I can't be no one else. No company in the world will allow me to do so. This is the work I can brag about. To me, this is the best design ever. Some eccentric German philosophers once said, "The best design is as little design as possible."

No! This blog is not built on top of *Gatsby*, *NextJS*, or *Svelt*. It's just a boring old static site you found in the 90's. Some pages look like a SPA (Single Page Application) but it's not. More on that later.

Here's the deal. WordPress gives out data through its API endpoint. Eleventy generates static sites from it. Nothing less. Nothing more.

Boring as it might be, I still follow the best practice. I take whatever Ady Osmani have to say to my heart. Critical path CSS, lazy loading, PWA, prefetching, caching, etc.

This is what Google think about my blog.

Mom, Dad! Look, I build a website "AS IS". No bullshit. Just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and everything in between bundled together. Boring, huh? What is SSR?

## The Author
I am a man behind this blog. This is how I portray myself:

I currently live in Bandung, Indonesia, and build user-facing features for [Stockbit](https://stockbit.com). This blog site is all about anything that interest me and most of my writings here are dedicated to the web in general.

Most of the time, I tinker with the DOM and Web API to create pleasing experience on the web. I am very grateful for picking up the right hobby.

Dear reader, I would like to be your friend and potential friends should know each other’s shortcomings. I suck at SQL, NoSQL, any kind of web frameworks (Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, etc), any kind of ORM libraries, or any fancy stuffs most developers love to talk about (shiny new technologies).

For more details, you can find me on LinkedIn, GitHub, CodePen, and Twitter. If you got any questions about anything, feel free to send me email.

I hope you will find this blog interesting.
