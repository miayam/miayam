## The Blog
The alternative version of this page is written in [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Bahasa.](/about/id){.a-langSwitcher}

The best thing I've ever done in my life. A place where I can be myself. I can't be no one else. No company in the world will allow me to do so. This is the work I can't stop bragging about! To me, this is the best design ever. Some eccentric German philosophers once said, "The best design is as little design as possible."

No! This blog is not built on top of *Gatsby*, *NextJS*, or *Svelte*. It's just a boring old static site you found in the 90s. Some pages look like SPA (Single Page Application) but they are not. More on that later.

Here's the deal: WordPress gives out data through its REST API endpoint. Eleventy generates static sites from it. Nothing less. Nothing more. For more info, please visit [https://docs.miayam.io](https://docs.miayam.io){ :target = "_blank" }.

As dull as one might expect, I still follow the best practice. I take whatever Addy Osmani has to say to heart. Critical path CSS, lazy loading, PWA, prefetching, caching, etc.

Look Ma, I built a website "AS IS"! No bullshit! Just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and everything in between bundled together. Boring, huh? This is legit!

I am a man behind this blog.

I currently build user-facing features for [Stockbit](https://stockbit.com). This blog site is all about anything that interests me.

Most of the time, I tinker with the DOM and Web API to create pleasing experience on the web. I am very grateful for picking up the right hobby.

Dear reader, I would like to be your friend and potential friends should know each otherâ€™s shortcomings. I suck at SQL, NoSQL, any kind of web frameworks (Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, etc), any kind of ORM libraries, or any fancy stuff most developers love to talk about (shiny new technology).

For more details, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/miayam), [GitHub](https://github.com/miayam), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/miayam), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/___miayam___). If you got any questions about anything, feel free to [send me email](mailto:muhammaddeni90@gmail.com).

I hope you will find this blog interesting.
